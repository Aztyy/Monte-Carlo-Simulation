# Probability and Statistics for Computer Science Final Project

Task: <br />
Twenty computers are connected in a network. One computer becomes infected with a virus. Every day, this virus spreads from any infected computer to any uninfected computer with probability 0.1. Also, everyday, a computer technician takes 5 infected computers at random (or all infected computers, if their number is less than 5) and removes the virus from them. <br />
Estimate: <br />
(a) the expected time it takes to remove the virus from the whole network; <br />
(b) the probability that each computer gets infected at least once? <br />
(c) the expected number of computers that get infected. <br />
